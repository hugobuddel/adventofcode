# 0: Introduction

Goal: attempt to figure out what the puzzle of day 17 of advent of
code 2021 is by reading CCC's rockstar solution from
https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ri9kdq/2021_day_17_solutions/hovxq0w/



# 1: Running

$ rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
a
Error: casted MYSTERIOUS
  day17part1byCCC.rocks:23 (day17part1byCCC.rocks L0): Cast my dreams into dreams

$ rockstar day17part2byCCC.rocks 
b
Error: casted MYSTERIOUS
  day17part2byCCC.rocks:38 (day17part2byCCC.rocks L0): Cast my dreams into reality

At least it compiles and runs!



# 2: First attempt at reading part 1

My poetry is gladly grammatical
Cast my poetry into the shelves

So the shelves is ASCII character 61. Which is "=", from
https://www.asciitable.com/
So far the poem is grammatical.

My poetry is ever honest
Cast my poetry into the spot

So the spot is ASCII character 46, which is ".".
I doubt this poem is honest though.

Let meaning be my poetry between my poetry
Let the realisation be nothing without meaning

Not sure what 'between' is. Division, as expected, from
https://codewithrockstar.com/docs

So meaning is 1 and the realisation is -1.
Nice construct and nice sentence.



# 3: First Listen

Listen to my heart

I will


Shatter my heart with the shelves

So my heart is a = separated string. Like "love=hate"

$ rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
love=hate
Error: casted MYSTERIOUS
  day17part1byCCC.rocks:23 (day17part1byCCC.rocks L0): Cast my dreams into dreams

Nope. Maybe a digit is requested? A floating point even, given that
the spot is a "."?

$ rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
pi=3.14
Error: casted MYSTERIOUS
  day17part1byCCC.rocks:23 (day17part1byCCC.rocks L0): Cast my dreams into dreams

$ rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
3.1=7.8
Error: casted MYSTERIOUS
  day17part1byCCC.rocks:23 (day17part1byCCC.rocks L0): Cast my dreams into dreams

Nope, lets read further.



# 4: Rolling ahead

Roll my heart
Roll my heart
Roll my heart into your hands

Okay, so we throw away the first two parts of the line. They are
probably used for part 2 of the puzzle.

$ rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
abc=def=3.14
Error: casted MYSTERIOUS
  day17part1byCCC.rocks:23 (day17part1byCCC.rocks L0): Cast my dreams into dreams




# 5: Trying Satriani

CCC develops with Satriani, so let's see what that does.

$ node rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
abc=def=3.14
Error: I don't know how to cast undefined
    at mutation (rockstar/satriani/satriani.interpreter.js:229:19)
    at evaluate (rockstar/satriani/satriani.interpreter.js:127:24)
    at assign (rockstar/satriani/satriani.interpreter.js:249:17)
    at evaluate (rockstar/satriani/satriani.interpreter.js:119:24)
    at evaluate (rockstar/satriani/satriani.interpreter.js:86:30)
    at Environment.run (rockstar/satriani/satriani.interpreter.js:53:22)
    at Interpreter.run (rockstar/satriani/satriani.js:11:24)
    at rockstar/satriani/rockstar.js:31:35
    at FSReqCallback.readFileAfterClose [as oncomplete] (internal/fs/read_file_context.js:71:3)

Those error messages aren't as useful as the ones from rocky.
So lets continue using rocky for now.



# 6: Reading wishes

Let my wish be your hands

This seems to be a lyrical expression that simply renames your hands
into my wish.

Shatter my wish with the spot

Split my wish with a period. So our guess input of abc=def=3.14 seem
sensible, as my wish should be 3.14 at this point.

Roll my wish into my heart
Roll my wish
Roll my wish into my dreams

A ha! We need at least two periods. So it is probably not a number.
Maybe it is a version string.

$ rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
numpy=develop=1.11.4
1

Yes!!! Output!

$ rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
rockstar=rocks=m.e.t.a.l
Error: NUMBER times NUMBER
  day17part1byCCC.rocks:24 (day17part1byCCC.rocks L0): Let hope be the realisation of hope

Let's continue reading.



# 7: Dream on

Cast my heart into hope
Cast my dreams into dreams

Make integers out of the strings. So the version numbers theory seems
to hold.

Let hope be the realisation of hope
Let reality be the realisation of dreams

Negate the integers.
Lovely lyrical construct!

If hope is greater than reality
  Let reality be hope

Make sure that reality (the last number) is never lower than hope
(the first number). Take into account that both are negative.
Or well, maybe they were negative and are now positive.
Reality is now the maximum of reality and hope.
This only makes sense when they both started positive or negative.
Nice lyrics!



# 8: Building up

Let hope be reality with the realisation

So hope is now -reality.
Reality could already be hope though. Now one is negative, the other
is positive.
[Edit: this is wrong, see step 11.]

Build meaning up

What was meaning again? Oh yes, 1, so now it is 2.

Let reality be hope of reality

Reality = hope * reality.
Keeping track of the signs, reality is now negative.

Let reality be reality between meaning

Divide reality by two.

Shout reality

Shouting is the most satisfying way to output things :-).



# 9: Running with some representative input

rockstar day17part1byCCC.rocks 
a=b=3.x.8
6

a=b=8.x.3
6

q=p=-5.0.-9
36

==-2..3
1



# 10: Do we understand this?

The format string is
something=anything=hope.whatever.dreams

Then this happens:

hope = -hope
dreams = -dreams
reality = max(hope, dreams)
hope = -reality
reality = hope * reality
reality /= 2
print(reality)

For hope, dreams = 3, 8, this results in -4.5, not 6.
For -5, -9 this is -40.5.

So our analysis failed!



# 11: Debug

Say meaning
Say the realisation

1
-1

as expected

Oh!!

Let hope be reality with the realisation

That is not a negation, but a subtraction of 1!
That is an addition of -1, not a multiplication!



# 12: Do we understand it now?

hope = -hope
dreams = -dreams
reality = max(hope, dreams)
hope = reality - 1
reality = hope * reality
reality /= 2
print(reality)

For hope, dreams = 3, 8, this results in 6.
For -5, -9 this is 36. 

Hoora, Hooray!



# 13: Questions?

Why all the negations?

reality = min(hope, dreams)
hope = reality + 1
reality = hope * reality
reality /= 2
print(reality)

would work as well. Probably preparation for part two.

Also, it is still absolutely not clear what is going on.



# 14: Hypotheses.

The calculation seems to produce the triangular number corresponding
to the lower number. Maybe some pairing is going on, like match
making, or shaking hands. Keeping with the story, this is the puzzle:

Your submarine (manned by gnomes) is stranded at an octopus party.
The two numbers are the number of octopi and the number of gnomes.
The gnomes and the octopi form dance couples. Since the number of
gnomes and octopi is not equal, some are left to be wall flowers and
are ignored.

After each song, the gnomes and octopi change partner. How many
gnome-octopus pairings occured during the party?
