Fire is combustible
Thorpor was a spellcaster necromancer.
Let Olvin be Thorpor without fire


A burst is a electrical destruction.
Let an outburst be a burst with fire
Let a detonation be an outburst with fire
Let an explosion be a detonation with fire
Let an eruption be an explosion with fire




Heat was temparature fantasticly high
Let a flare be heat with fire
Let ember be a flare with fire
Let a flame be ember with fire
Let a blast be a flame with fire
Let a blaze be a blast with fire
Let inferno be a blaze with fire

Burn a burst
Burn an outburst
Burn a detonation
Burn an explosion
Burn an eruption
Burn Thorpor
Burn Olvin
Burn heat
Burn a flare
Burn ember
Burn a flame
Burn a blast
Burn a blaze
Burn inferno


Let the world be nothing

Wizard wants globe
Let globule be globe without fire
Rock ruler
While globule is as great as nothing
Rock ruler with globe at globule
Knock globule down

Give ruler



Destroyed wants power, energy
Let powerton be wizard taking power
rock powerton with energy
give wizard taking powerton




The weather was tornadoes
Storm takes lives
If lives are as strong as lightning
If lives are as weak as the weather
Burn lives
Give it back
